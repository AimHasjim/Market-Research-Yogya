### Commitment Pricing
<p>Usually, an HMO rent are paid monthly. But there are cases that the owner needs the customer to pay  the HMOS every 3 months, 6 months, or even a year. This will effect the price of HMOs. The effect can be seen in the graph below</p>
<p> We can see that HMOs that the renters are commited to pay longer months are on average cheaper that HMOs that the renters are not commited to pay longer. This may be caused by several reasons. First, a longer commitment means that if the customer somehow needs to change HMOs in less than the commitment time, the customer had already paid the full commitment time. <b>So, the owner use this strategy to keep customer stay in their HMO</b>. The second reason is because a change of renter may need additional repair or renovations. If the HMO keeps changing renters, <b>there will be more cost incurred to repair the room from the previous renter</b></p>
